# ArbitraGenius Site

This React application provides informational pages for three calculators: Bonus Optimizer, Arbitrage Calculator, and Margin Checker. It was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Replacing Placeholder Screenshots

Placeholder text files are located in `public/assets/` and are referenced by the pages instead of images. Replace each `.txt` file with an actual image using the same filename but with an image extension (e.g. `.png`) and update the page components to load your image.
